Title: Calculation of IBD Probabilities
Description: For biparental, three and four-way crosses Identity by Descent 
    (IBD) probabilities can be calculated using Hidden Markov Models and 
    inheritance vectors following Lander and Green
    (<https://www.jstor.org/stable/29713>) and Huang
    (<doi:10.1073/pnas.1100465108>). One of a series of statistical genetic 
    packages for streamlining the analysis of typical plant breeding experiments
    developed by Biometris.
